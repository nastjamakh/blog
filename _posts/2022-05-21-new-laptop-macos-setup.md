This guide describes how to install your apps and development tools, as well as configure your coding environment with one script.

Getting a new laptop is, although very exciting, also takes some time to install all your favourote apps and packages. Years ago I used to go through this process manually, by writing down everything installed on my last laptop, and googling links to get it on my shiny new one. Now that command line is an essential part of flow, I much rather spend a few hours writing a few setup scripts than clicking around in web browser.

This post assumes that you work with *brew* and *Visual Studio Code*.

## I. Migrating from Another Laptop
If you do not have a functional laptop with settings you wish to transfer, skip this step.

### Installation script 1: apps

There is a wonderfull brew package `mas` that allows to download *App Store* apps directly from the command line.

List your installed apps with 
~~~bash
brew install mas    # if do not have it installed
mas list

# prefix each app ID with install command and save to a file.
echo '#!/bin/sh'  >> 'apps.sh'
mas list | xargs -L 1 echo | grep -o "^\w*\b" | xargs -L 1 echo mas installed >> 'apps.sh'
brew list --cask | xargs -L 1 echo brew install --cask >> 'apps.sh'
~~~

Unfortunately we cannot make `mas` print just a list of applications IDs. Hence we do a bit of hacking on the command line with `xargs` and `grep`.

* We are adding `#!/bin/sh` at the top of each script to make them executable.
* `xargs` allows us to operate on each line separately (pipe echo and grep commands to each line)
* We select the first string of each line with `grep` (to only select the application ID without name and version)
* each line is then prefixed with installation command
* save results to a script

We append installation commands for apps installed with brew cask in the same script.

### Installation script 2: brew packages

Now we are doing similar things with brew formulae.
~~~bash
echo '#!/bin/sh'  >> 'brew.sh'
brew list --formulae | xargs -L 1 echo brew install >> 'brew.sh'
~~~
### Installation script 3: VS Code extensions

~~~bash
echo '#!/bin/sh'  >> 'vscode.sh'
code --list-extensions | xargs -L 1 echo code --install-extension >> 'vscode.sh'
~~~

Now we have two installation scripts ready, one for brew formulae, one for apps (from brew cask and app store). We just have to append `#!/bin/sh` at the top of each to maek them executable, and run `chmod -R 755 <script.sh>` to get access permissions to run them.

Here is how my `brew.sh` scripts looks like:
~~~bash
#!/bin/sh

### Setup script: shell

I use zsh, but you can do similar for bash.

Note that installing `iterm2` should be done in a previous step, but I am adding it here as well to have everything relate to shell setup in one place.


~~~bash
#!/bin/sh

brew install --cask iterm2
brew install zsh                        # UNIX shell (command interpreter)

# zsh extensions
brew install zsh-autosuggestions        # 
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting    # Fish shell like syntax highlighting for zsh

# Copy ZSH config
cp -R .zshrc ~/.zshrc
~~~


### Setup script: git

~~~bash
#!/bin/sh

echo Enter your git username:
read gitusername
echo Enter your git email:
read gitemail
git config --global user.name gitusername
git config --global user.email gitemail
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

# Generate new SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C gitemail
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
echo 'Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519' >> ~/.ssh/config
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# add SSH key to GitHub (you must be logged in)
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
open https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
~~~

### Putting it all together
~~~bash
#!/bin/sh

# Install Xcode Developer Tools
xcode-select --install

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Get permissions to acees the scripts
chmod -R 755 .

# Installing Homebrew packages
source ./brew.sh

# Installing Homebrew Cask and App Store apps
source ./apps.sh

# Setting up shell with zsh
source ./shell.sh

# Setting up git
source ./git.sh

# Installing Node.js
source ./nvm.sh

# Installing Python version manager
source ./python.sh

# Install current version of Ruby
source ./ruby.sh

# Install Visual Studio Code Extensions
source ./vscode.sh

# System configuration
source ./config.sh
~~~

## II. New Laptop

Now all we need to do is clone our setup repo on the new laptop, navigate to a folder with our scripts and run

~~~bash
./init.sh
~~~

It will install all your apps and brew packages, configure git on the comamnd line, install python and create virtual environmnets with pyenv.
